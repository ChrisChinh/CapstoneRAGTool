### FAILED REFACTORING AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS ❌

The model could not resolve the final issue:
Critique: The refactored IPP code does not achieve functional parity with the original C code. The original code uses custom memory management and mathematical operations, while the refactored code uses IPP library functions for memory allocation and FIR operations. The IPP functions may not handle memory allocation and error conditions in the same way as the original code, potentially leading to different behavior in edge cases. Additionally, the refactored code does not include equivalent error handling for memory allocation failures and does not ensure that the IPP FIR state is properly initialized and used. The use of IPP functions like ippsFIR_32f and ippsAdd_32f_I assumes the existence of a properly initialized FIR state, which is not demonstrated in the refactored code. Furthermore, the refactored code does not handle the history buffer and delay line in the same manner, which could lead to discrepancies in the filter's output.
